This answer on stack overflow has a python solution to help streamline these commands:

However, I was not able to get it running without some small modifications on my system and decided to create this repository.
Also, it is a good reference to remember how to execute the script since I do not use python that often.  
To run and write to file:
```
python3 gcloudips.py
```

To run just the commands and print to standard out:
```
python3 -c 'import gcloudips; print(list(gcloudips.get_all_ip_cidrs()))'
```
To get the IPs for a specifc netblock only:
```
python3 -c 'import gcloudips; print(list(gcloudips.get_netblock_ips_cidr(5)))'
```
